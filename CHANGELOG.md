# Changelog

All notable changes to OxyBrush. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: anything may change).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Help menu for testers:** Report a bug (opens a GitHub issue form with your version, OS and GPU pre-filled), Send feedback, Copy system info, Open log folder, Getting started guide, Changelog.
- **Log file:** every run writes `oxybrush.log` to the per-user data folder; the previous run is kept as `oxybrush.previous.log`, and crashes (panics) are logged with a backtrace. Windows release builds previously had no log output at all.
- About window shows OS, GPU and log location, with a Copy system info button.
- Alpha testing guide, issue forms for bug reports and tester feedback.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` (living roadmap and status), `AGENTS.md` (instructions for AI coding agents).

## [0.0.1-alpha] - 2026-11-01

First public alpha.

### Added
- **Sculpting:** 12 brushes — Draw, Clay, Clay Strips, Smooth, Inflate, Flatten, Pinch, Crease, Layer, Grab, Snake Hook, Mask — with falloff curves, spacing, auto-smooth and pen-pressure options.
- **Symmetry:** X/Y/Z mirror and radial (up to 64 copies around any axis).
- **Pieces:** several meshes per document; add, duplicate, mirror-duplicate, delete, rename, hide, solo; Alt+click to make a piece active.
- **Topology:** voxel remesh, merge visible pieces (union), quadric decimation, subdivision (linear and smooth); long operations run in the background.
- **Face groups and visibility:** group visible / from mask / by islands, Ctrl+Shift+click to isolate a group, invert visibility, delete hidden, group color overlay.
- **Masking:** paint, unmask, invert, clear, show/hide.
- **Files:** `.oxb` project format (versioned, compressed, checksummed, atomic saves), autosave every 2 minutes with crash recovery, unsaved-changes prompt; OBJ/STL import as pieces; OBJ/binary STL export of visible pieces.
- **Undo/redo** for strokes, topology, face edits and piece changes, within a memory budget.
- **Viewport:** wgpu matcap rendering with five procedurally generated materials, orthographic/perspective, front/side/top views.
- **Interface:** brush shelf, inspector, history list, shortcut reference (F1), UI scaling, high-contrast theme, screen-reader labels (AccessKit).
- **Packaging:** Windows installer (per-user, `.oxb` association) and portable zip; Linux Flatpak and portable tarball; SHA-256 checksums.
- ZBrush file-format research tooling (`oxy-ztl`, milestone 0; no import yet).

### Known limitations
- Pen pressure not yet verified on Windows Ink or Linux tablets.
- Decimating very dense meshes is slow (~10 s for 1.3M triangles).
- Remesh resets mask and face groups; open surfaces remesh to a thin shell.
- Settings are not remembered between sessions.
- The Windows installer is not code-signed (SmartScreen warning).
