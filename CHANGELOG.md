# Changelog

All notable changes to OxyBrush. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: anything may change).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Subdivision levels (multiresolution):** Ctrl+D adds a level, D / Shift+D step up and down. Sculpt at any level; changes on a lower level carry the higher-level detail along. Delete higher or lower levels from the Mesh menu. Levels are saved in `.oxb` projects (a new, skippable section, so older versions still open the file at the active level) and undo restores them after remesh or decimate.

### Changed
- **Friendlier interface:** a welcome window with starter shapes (sphere, cube, plane), open/import and the basics; drawn icons for every brush showing its effect, with descriptions in tooltips; a toolbar with undo/redo, brush size and strength, mirror axes, subdivision levels, view toggles and material; collapsible right-panel sections with explanations on hover; the status bar shows what the held modifier keys do; a warmer theme with more spacing and rounded controls. **Help > Welcome screen** reopens the welcome window.
- **D** now steps up a subdivision level instead of subdividing the mesh in place; the old one-off subdivide is **Mesh > Subdivide (single mesh)**.

### Known limitations
- Switching to a very dense level (~5M triangles) pauses the UI for 2–4 seconds.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-11-01

### Added
- **macOS:** a universal `.dmg` that runs natively on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs (macOS 11 or newer).
- **Brushes:** Polish (flattens bumps without shrinking), Planar Trim (cuts down to a plane; inverted fills up to it), Topological Move (moves only the connected surface under the brush, so nearby separate parts stay put) and Noise (procedural surface noise with adjustable scale). 16 brushes in total.
- **Stroke control:** stabilizer ("lazy mouse") for smooth lines; stroke modes Freehand, Line (drag a straight line) and Stamp (drag out a single dab: distance sets the size, direction the rotation); spray (scatters position, rotation and strength); pressure curve.
- **Alphas:** grayscale images shape each dab. Seven built-in procedural alphas (Noise, Bumps, Scales, Cracks, Stripes, Rings, Square) and your own grayscale PNGs; rotation and follow-stroke options.
- **Masking and selection:** Ctrl+drag on empty space masks a rectangle or lasso (Ctrl+Alt unmasks); Ctrl+click on empty space blurs the mask; Ctrl+Shift+drag shows only the selection (Alt hides it); L toggles rectangle/lasso. Mask cavities, mask peaks, mask the face group under the cursor (Ctrl+M), blur, sharpen, grow and shrink the mask; grow and shrink the visible area.
- **Help menu for testers:** Report a bug (opens a GitHub issue form with your version, OS and GPU pre-filled), Send feedback, Copy system info, Open log folder, Getting started guide, Changelog.
- **Log file:** every run writes `oxybrush.log` to the per-user data folder; the previous run is kept as `oxybrush.previous.log`, and crashes (panics) are logged with a backtrace. Windows release builds previously had no log output at all.
- About window shows OS, GPU and log location, with a Copy system info button.
- Alpha testing guide, issue forms for bug reports and tester feedback.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` (living roadmap and status), `AGENTS.md` (instructions for AI coding agents).

### Changed
- Escape cancels an in-progress selection, line or stamp.
- Ctrl+Shift+click now acts on release (so the same gesture can start a box selection).

### Known limitations
- The macOS app is not notarized: the first launch needs "Open Anyway" in System Settings (see the testing guide). Double-clicking `.oxb` files doesn't open them on macOS yet; use File > Open.
- Stencils (screen-space alpha overlays), multiresolution and the 10M-triangle performance work are still to come (Phase 3).
- Pen pressure is still unverified on real tablets on every platform.

## [0.0.1-alpha] - 2026-11-01

First public alpha.

### Added
- **Sculpting:** 12 brushes — Draw, Clay, Clay Strips, Smooth, Inflate, Flatten, Pinch, Crease, Layer, Grab, Snake Hook, Mask — with falloff curves, spacing, auto-smooth and pen-pressure options.
- **Symmetry:** X/Y/Z mirror and radial (up to 64 copies around any axis).
- **Pieces:** several meshes per document; add, duplicate, mirror-duplicate, delete, rename, hide, solo; Alt+click to make a piece active.
- **Topology:** voxel remesh, merge visible pieces (union), quadric decimation, subdivision (linear and smooth); long operations run in the background.
- **Face groups and visibility:** group visible / from mask / by islands, Ctrl+Shift+click to isolate a group, invert visibility, delete hidden, group color overlay.
- **Masking:** paint, unmask, invert, clear, show/hide.
- **Files:** `.oxb` project format (versioned, compressed, checksummed, atomic saves), autosave every 2 minutes with crash recovery, unsaved-changes prompt; OBJ/STL import as pieces; OBJ/binary STL export of visible pieces.
- **Undo/redo** for strokes, topology, face edits and piece changes, within a memory budget.
- **Viewport:** wgpu matcap rendering with five procedurally generated materials, orthographic/perspective, front/side/top views.
- **Interface:** brush shelf, inspector, history list, shortcut reference (F1), UI scaling, high-contrast theme, screen-reader labels (AccessKit).
- **Packaging:** Windows installer (per-user, `.oxb` association) and portable zip; Linux Flatpak and portable tarball; SHA-256 checksums.
- ZBrush file-format research tooling (`oxy-ztl`, milestone 0; no import yet).

### Known limitations
- Pen pressure not yet verified on Windows Ink or Linux tablets.
- Decimating very dense meshes is slow (~10 s for 1.3M triangles).
- Remesh resets mask and face groups; open surfaces remesh to a thin shell.
- Settings are not remembered between sessions.
- The Windows installer is not code-signed (SmartScreen warning).
